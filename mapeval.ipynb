Jason was our server and was so kind and gave us wonderful suggestions. He was amazing  Food was so very good.  Best burger ever. We also got the baklava and the  cheesecake neither disappointed.

      "   2. Natalie Jones (Rating: 5): I really believe more people should be checking this place out for the great value three course lunch offer they have.\n",
      "We went in and had the aforementioned lunch and could find no fault in the quality and portions. Absolutely perfect for the price paid.\n",
      "Atmosphere was the only let down in this striking venue, due to it being somewhat empty. I genuinely don't understand with Strip prices being on the high side why more people aren't taking up this offer.\n",
      "The meat sushi is a must try and I would return just to have that alone!\n",
      "   3. Monica Saenz (Rating: 5): I have now been to this amazing restaurant a few times due to the convenient location. I KEEP coming back for the amazing people!! The manager Mark W. Is so very welcoming and makes you feel right at home! He is outgoing and pays attention to the small details! He is constantly working the floor and taking care of his customers. The bar staff Erik and Q go above and beyond to take care of all of the clients at the bar! The kitchen staff is outstanding! Chef Mike has the best food I have ever tried! He runs the kitchen so well and the food is always amazing and delicious you will not be disappointed!!  Some of his kitchen staff including Johnny, Isaiah and Joel are always welcoming and go the extra mile to make your dining experience even better  this is now where I tell all of my out of town friends to visit! If you haven't been it's a must do!! You won't be disappointed at all!\n",
      "   4. _Adams_ 46 (Rating: 5): The food was amazing! Loved the wagyu burger flavor and juiciness! 🤩 Jason was our server and treated us like Kings. Atmosphere was wonderful. The service is top notch and we were so pleasantly impressed with everything!\n",
